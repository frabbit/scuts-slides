### Motivation

- Concept and name **type class** coming from haskell 
- the (same) concept is called **traits** in rust 
- **Concepts** are a planned feature for C++
- **type classes** can be used in scala in combination with implicits (scala traits are **not** the same as type classes) 
- Purescript (Strict Haskell for the Browser) has them.
